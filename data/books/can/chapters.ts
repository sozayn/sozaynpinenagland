      paragraphs: [
        "Close your eyes for a second. Think of one dream you’ve had — something you want so badly that the thought of it makes your chest tighten. It could be starting your own business, creating music, traveling the world, building something nobody’s seen before, or simply living life on your own terms.",
        "Now open your eyes. That dream is possible. Not because the world is fair. Not because someone’s going to hand it to you. But because of one truth this book will prove over and over: Anyone CAN be successful.",
        "The word “CAN” is more than a word. It’s a formula. A system. A way of seeing reality that reveals patterns hidden in plain sight — patterns that connect the past, the present, and the future. And once you see those patterns, you’ll never unsee them.",
        "Success is not a miracle for the chosen; it is a process you can master. It follows specific laws, like gravity or lightning. It leaves clear clues and repeats in patterns."

      paragraphs: [
        "In this book, CAN is much more than a motivational word—it is a rigorous formula. It is the hidden DNA of success followed by every great thinker, inventor, and leader in history.",
        "The formula is comprised of three pillars: Collection, Abstraction, and Narration.",
        "1. Collection: The deliberate gathering of knowledge, facts, and experiences. You cannot create from nothing; the difference between mediocrity and success isn't what you have access to, but what you choose to collect.",
        "2. Abstraction: The art of zooming out to find the 'signal' in the 'noise'. It is the skill of noticing what others miss. A scientist abstracts a repeating result; a creator abstracts a viral rhythm.",
        "3. Narration: The final stage where you package your insights into a story—both for the world and for yourself. Without narration, wisdom stays silent. But when you narrate, you transform your collection and abstraction into a reality that moves people.",
        "CAN is not a one-time event; it is a loop. That narration then becomes new material for the next collection—creating a repeatable cycle of success."

    content: {
      subheading: 'History as a Mirror',
      paragraphs: [
        "Most of us grow up believing that history is a dry subject—a museum of names, dates, and wars that ended long ago. But history is not about the past; it is about patterns. And patterns repeat.",
        "If you learn to read history like a code, it stops being a school subject and becomes a tool for predicting the future. The same forces that built ancient civilizations and triggered modern revolutions are active right now. The only thing that has changed is the technology.",
        "Successful people treat history like a mirror. They ask: What has happened before? What worked, and what failed? How can I apply these lessons to my own time?",
        "Observation creates leverage. Ancient wisdom used stars and geometry; today we scroll digital feeds, but the principle remains: those who notice the patterns are the ones who thrive.",
        "Ignoring history is like walking into a maze blindfolded. Using the CAN formula on history gives you the blueprint to walk out."

      paragraphs: [
        "Ancient civilizations were not primitive; they were sophisticated pattern-seekers. They encoded their discoveries into a language we still use today: myths, symbols, and numbers.",
        "The ancients believed numbers carried energy and secrets beyond mere counting. Three numbers, in particular, appear across almost every major civilization: 3, 6, and 9.",
        "3 (Balance and Harmony): Represented by the pyramids, the Trimurti, and the Trinity.",

        "You stand at the edge of the AI Age — a revolution as big as fire, the printing press, or electricity. AI is neither a monster nor a miracle; it is a tool — and like fire, its impact depends entirely on how we use it.",
        "AI is a Mirror: It reflects what we put into it, learning patterns from our language, art, and data at lightning speed. It is not conscious; it doesn't 'want,' 'plan,' or 'dream'. It calculates and imitates.",
        "AI is the Machine Version of CAN. It runs the formula at high speed. The difference between AI and you is Meaning. AI generates the pattern, but it cannot tell you why it matters.",
        "The tool is not the story. You are the story. AI is simply your most powerful assistant. The real question is: how will you collect, abstract, and narrate in this new age?"
